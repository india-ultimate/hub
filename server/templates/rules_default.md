## Rules

### All games are played by WFDF 2021 rules

### Game Time, Time Outs, Scores

- For **75 minutes**

  - Game to 15
  - 2 min half at 8 goals or 40 mins (at 40 min, finish point, if no team has reached 8, add +1 to higher score, take half when either team reaches this score)
  - 1 time out, 2min, per team per half (can be taken after time caps too)
  - When 75 mins is up, finish the point then reduce points target to current highest score +1 (but never exceed 15)

- Top 8 (All Games) **100 minutes**
  - Game to 15
  - 7 minutes half at 8 goals or 55 minutes( at 55 min, finish point, if no team has reached 8, add +1 to higher score, take half when either team reaches this score)
  - 2 time-out per team per half. 75 secs for each timeout. (can be taken after time caps too)
  - When 100 mins is up, finish the point then reduce points target to current highest score +1 (but never exceed 15)

### Ratio Rules

Ratio Rules for National championship series 2022- 2023 (from WFDF Championship Rules 2021-24 A6.2.1)

A7.2.1. At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional disc flip happens with the winner selecting the gender ratio for the first point. For the second and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points the ratio must be same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern)

### Gender Pull

- A player representing the gender with four players on the field must pull for that point.
- If a team breaches this rule, a violation may be called by the opposing team before the offence touches the disc and play should start again with a repull.

### Time Limits & Consequences

We expect all teams to strictly adhere to the timelines between points.

From the end of the previous point:

- Offense has 60 seconds to be ready for the subsequent point
- Defence has 75 seconds to be ready and initiate the pull or 15 seconds from the time Offence shows readiness.

If either the Offence of defence does not adhere to the pre pull time limits, a “pre-pull time limit violation” may be called by the affected team (no penalty shall apply for the first “pre-pull time limit violation”. For any subsequent “pre-pull time limit violation” by either the Offence of the Defence

- If Offence is not ready on time, then Defence calls "delay of game" and shall initiate the pull when Offence is ready and the Defence is allowed to set up Defence in the same manner as after a time-out has been called.
- If Defence is not ready on time, then the Offence "calls delay of game", and once the Defence initiates the pull, the Offence can choose to "brick" the pull regardless of where the disc lands.

For this event, WFDF Championship Timings will be in effect. You can read about the timings on the one page summary, and about the consequences for violating timings in Appendix A5.

For any further clarification concerning time limits, please refer to Appendix A: WFDF Additional Championship Game Rules, Clause A.5. “Time Limits” WFDF Rules, 2021.

### Re-seeding

Re-seeding within a pool means that, if a pool initially contains seeds 1, 3, 6, 8 and 9 then after the re-seed the winner of the pool automatically takes the 1st seed, 2nd place in the pool takes 3rd overall, 3rd takes 6th, 4th takes 8th and 5th takes 9th regardless of number of the results or goal difference of teams in other pools. This is the conventional WFDF format.

### Tie-breaking within a pool (in order) [from WFDF championship appendix]

- Games won in pool (not a tie)
- Games won counting only games between tied teams
- Points difference counting only games between tied teams
- Points difference counting all pool games
- Points scored counting only games betweened tied teams
- Points scored counting all pool games
- Longest throw (one player per team)
- When more than 2 Teams are tied, we will use this same system for all Teams involved (eg 1.Games won between tied teams, 2...); removing Teams immediately that come out on top/bottom and starting again till we have a clear Ranking of relevant Teams
