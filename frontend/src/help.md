# One Tap Login

## Overview

- We have introduced new One Tap Login feature to help you do **passwordless** login super-fast!
- This is done using Passkeys which are stored on your devices and can be used via device pin / biometric authentication.

## How to use?

- Step 1: Login via OTP and go to Dashboard
- Step 2: Click on _"Enable One-Tap Login for this device"_ under _User Actions_ and allow the browser to create a passkey for The Hub.
- Step 3: You can now logout and login anytime through One-Tap Login Tab in Login Page.

## Note

Passkeys are supported only in the latest browsers (Chrome / Firefox / Safari).
If passkeys are not supported in your browser you won't be able to see the buttons to create and login via One-Tap Login.
